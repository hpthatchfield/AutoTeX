# AutoTeX

A machine learning pipeline to classify mathematical expressions (printed or handwritten) into categories like integrals, derivatives, matrices, and more—serving as a foundation for LaTeX string prediction and document understanding.

## Project Goals

- Detect and classify visual math expressions using deep learning
- Demonstrate end-to-end ML engineering: data generation, preprocessing, training, and deployment
- Build toward LaTeX OCR automation with explainable, modular components

## Why This Project?

Academic and research documents are rich in mathematical content, but understanding math structure from images remains a challenge. 
This project explores a path toward automating that process—starting with classification as a stepping stone to full LaTeX generation.
